# HTML Drill #1 - `nav`, `header`, and accessible char codes

## Setup

Within the root of this folder, create a new `.html` file with your group's unique name.

## HTML Writing

1. Usual suspects: `doctype`, `html` with the `head` and `body`.
2. Add some basic elements within the `head`, such as the `title`.
3. Inside the `body`, write an `article`.
4. Inside the `article`, writing the following: `header` and 2 `div` elements in that order.
5. Inside the `header`, write a 50x50 placeholder `img` with a `class` attribute with a value of `profile_pic`. Don't forget the `alt` attribute!
6. Still in the `header`, add a short `p` after the `img`.
7. Apply the following `class` names to the `div` elements in this order:
   1. `gallery`
   2. `response_buttons`
8. Inside the `div` with the class `gallery` write a 400x300 placeholder `img`. Don't forget the `alt` attribute!

When you are finished, please commit and push your code to our repo.
